This is a multithreaded modem server that receives
SMS messages via modems connected to a Moxa box.

After receiving an SMS it parses it, extracting relevant fields,
and sends the messages along via a HTTP based protocol.
It has been tested with Siemens TC35 modems.


The development of this project was sponsored by MimerGroup/MimerMobile,
